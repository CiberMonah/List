# List
Here is an implementation of a doubly linked list in an array. This implementation allows you to access any of the list items to insert/delete at the same time.

# DUMP

I used graphviz  https://graphviz.org/ to make images of list

dot my_dot*.dot -T png -o my_dot*.png

type this in console to make inage from dot file

My dump generates images and put them to one html file for convenient debugging
